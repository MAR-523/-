## [Implement the naïve birthday attack of reduced SM3](https://github.com/MAR-523/-/tree/main/SM3_birthday_attack)  
## [Implement the Rho method of reduced SM3](https://github.com/MAR-523/-/tree/main/SM3_pho_attack)  
## [Implement length extension attack for SM3, SHA256, etc.](https://github.com/MAR-523/-/tree/main/sha256_length_expanding_attack)  
## [Do your best to optimize SM3 implementation (software)](https://github.com/MAR-523/-/tree/main/sm3_optimize)  
## Impl Merkle Tree following RFC6962  
## Try to Implement this scheme  
---  
## Report on the application of this deduce technique in Ethereum with ECDSA  
## Impl sm2 with RFC6979
## Verify the above pitfalls with proof-of-concept code
## Implement the above ECMH scheme
## [Implement a PGP scheme with SM2](https://github.com/MAR-523/-/tree/main/sm3_optimize)  
## Implement sm2 2P sign with real network communication
## [PoC impl of the scheme, or do implement analysis by Google](https://github.com/MAR-523/-/tree/main/SM3_PoC)
## Implement sm2 2P decrypt with real network communication  
---  
## [Send a tx on Bitcoin testnet, and parse the tx data down to every bit, better write script yourself](https://github.com/MAR-523/-/tree/main/Bitcoin_tx_analyse)
## Forge a signature to pretend that you are Satoshi
---  
## Sesearch report on MPT  
---  
## Find a key with hash value “*sdu_cst_20220610*” under a message composed of *your name* followed by *your student ID*. For example, “*San Zhan 202000460001*”  
## Find a 64-byte message under some k fulfilling that their hash value is symmetrical  
---  
## Write a circuit to prove that your CET6 grade is larger than 425.  
### a.Your grade info is like (cn_id, grade, year, sig_by_moe). These grades are published as commitments onchain by MoE.  
### b.When you got an interview from an employer, you can prove to them that you have passed the exam without letting them know the exact grade.  
## The commitment scheme used by MoE is SHA256-based.
### a. commit = SHA256(cn_id, grade, year, sig_by_moe, r)
